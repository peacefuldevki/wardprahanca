👋 Hey, I’m darius🛡️ and I am interested in tech, nature and real estate with almost 4 years of professional experience in web development with Ruby on Rails.

I’m currently learning Javascript, React and trying Hotwire and Stimulus with Ruby on Rails 🤖

🤝For now, I’m looking to collaborate on any Ruby on Rails project, part-time/full-time contracts or just tasks in order to boost your business and help you out with saving precious time.
